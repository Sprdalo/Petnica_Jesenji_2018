Quest for digital currency

-Started in 90s
	DigiCash,E-Gold,PayPal,Libery reserve
-All were centralized
-Killed by US government because of money laundering.
-Because digital money creates new scam methods, and financial institutions were not ready, digital currency had to be DISTRIBUTED

How to create distributed currency?
	-Paper cant be copied. Information can. So we need database of all coins and their owners
	-That database is single point of failure and control. It must be distributed.
	-Distributed database are HARD. Distributed databases on thousands of untrusted computers are very very hard.

Problems
	-Authentication
		Only I can spend my money
	-Privacy
		All transactions are public
	-Trust, Intergrity
		Somebody can change the data
	-Consistency, Integrity
		Hash, Clearing

	Solutions
	-Authentication 
		Public key cryptography
	-Privacy
		Public key cryptography
	-Trust, Intergrity
		Clearing
	-Consistency, Integrity
		Hash, Clearing

Public key cryptography
	- Public key is adress:
